  Coding a project from scratch can be quite an undertaking and it's easy, normal even, to get overwhelmed by all the many things that go with creating something from nothing. I hope by the end of this post, you will be more confident in your ability to really get the job done and to do it well. 
						 
  Like anything else, projects are best accomplished by breaking them down into smaller steps. Before you even begin to code, you must plan several things in advance to have on hand for reference. Picture the project as this mass jungle of things to do and only you, the explorer, can find the right path by creating a map of which direction to take. 

I've created a list of five simple steps to help you on your project. But it's up to you to create the right map for the project you want. 

Let's get started!

### 1.  Purpose or What Will My Project Be Used For?
 
 Usually a project is laid out based on the needs of the user. But if you have your own idea for a project you must ask yourself, "What will my project be used for?" Is there a need for this particular project or is it just for fun? 
 There's really no right or wrong answer. This is just to center yourself on what you're doing so you have a clear goal in mind. 
 
### 2.  Pseudocode or What is My Code Actually Doing?  

  Next, write out a basic outline of what your code is actually doing. This is referred to as pseudocode because you'de never actually code it this way. Again, this just a reference point or to do list of your code. Writers use these all the time as an outline. 
	
This is an example for a Product Landing Page I created "Unicorn Treats", a fake product for pet unicorns.

As you can see, there's nothing fancy about pseudocode. But it gets the job done because you now have your outline. 

### 3.  Design or How Do I Want My Project To Look? 

 Remember those hand-drawn Disney classic films? The creators would put a string of hand-drawn pictures together to get a basic idea of the plot of the story and what it should look like all at once. They were, in essence, designing the film in its most basic form. That's all you need to do. Get a piece of paper and draw a rough sketch of what you'd like your finished project to look like. Just a simple diagram will do. 
				 
Like this:

 It's nothing fancy, but it gets a basic idea in your head of where you what everything to go. Somewhat like an architect designing a blueprint for a house. You need to know where everything goes before you start building. Whew! That was alot of work. And you haven't even written one line of code yet! But I assure you, in the long run, this will save you loads of time and hours of frustration. Now to actually start coding! 
 
### 4.  Actually Coding The Project 

   Planning is one thing, but implementing the plan is quite another. Don't be discouraged it your code doesn't look right at this point. Just go through the list of pseudocode as quickly as possible. Think of this step as quarrying a block of marble that you will soon sculpt into an elegant statue. it's not very pleasant to look at but soon, when the block is finished, you will began the sculpting process. 
	 
Right now, focus on the functionality of the project. This step is all about getting the code down on your text editor. Writers do it all the time. They have a furious burst of writing, then go back and rewrite and rewrite. One writer said he considered changing his title to rewriter because he spent more time rewriting than he actually did writing! This is a good approach to coding as well. Which brings us to the final step to completing your project. 
	 
### 5.  Edit or Is This The Best Way To Code My Project?

  Editing your project is by far the most tedious step. You're almost finished and aching to hit the publish button or share with your fellow devs. But don't skimp on this! I've done this on my first project I ever worked on because I was so frustrated and just wanted to be done with it. I'm still ashamed that I hurried the editing process and missed out on a chance to be really proud of something I had done. 
	
Remember, if you're not excited to show it off, it probably needs more work. Don't be afraid to ask for help either. Put your problems down on paper and Google each one of them until it looks right. It doesn't have to look perfect but it should look presentable and functional when it's completed. 
	
Here's my finished project of ["Unicorn Treats"](https://codepen.io/donnacamos88/full/oPbdeg), if you'de like to see how it turned out. 
		 
I can't wait to see what you come up with! 

Good luck!
